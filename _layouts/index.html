    <ul>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work.</li>
      <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.</li>
